Many web developers use libraries as jQuery and Prototype so they
don't have to deal with the trivial parts of web development, such
as selecting and manipulating DOM elements. Often, you'll find
that these libraries include a lot of functionality that you
aren't using. It's sometimes a good idea to ask yourself if you
really need a 50-100k library or if something simpler and smaller
will do, specially when developing for mobile platforms where 
a fast Internet isn't guaranteed. pg 42

The MicroJS website(htts://microjs) features a collection of
micro libraries that focuses on particular areas rather than
elaborate frameworks.
