#Pure DOM Vs. canvas-based game

Both solutions are viable, but do not cover the same needs. The
solution depends on the game type.

Choosing this solution [canvas] means reducing the usage of CSS
and HTML, so everything these technologies gives us now has to be
implemented in JavaScript.

For now, pure DOM approach is usually better because it takes more
advantage of web technologies.

The good thing with HTML- and JavaScript-based applications is
that the technology itself forces you into some kind of structure.

Everything seems very easy at first, but it's for sure that it
will turn into more code  than you originally expected.

A good tool to perform this [micro optimizations] is found at jsfiddle.net.
The more advanced engines become, the less important these micro
optimizations will become.


As your skill level improves, you will find that moving more
functionality to the shader can improve perfomance and offer a
wide range of cool effects and realism.

It's a good idea to use the newer browser method,
window.requestAnimationFrame, because it will not animate a scene
when you are in another browser tab. This also means that extra
battery life will not be needlessly wasted on mobile devices.

When creating a geme, you should plan what you whish to accomplish
and how to implement it (at a high level) before you write any
code.

WebGL is a port of the OpenGL ES API to the web browser. It allows
Javascript code to directly display and manipulate 3D scenes of an
HML5 canvas embedded in a web page.

Using requestAnimationFrame() is currently the recommended method
of making animation in HTML5.

One can only hope that as browser technology progress and WebGL
becomes more robustly supported, the guarantees on frame rate will
become more robust as well.

As for the genre, it can pose stringent requirements to an engine
part. FPS games call for short ping times, whereas an RPG may
require large cache.

The crucial and most complicated stage of develpment, which is
choosing the technology.

JSGameBench, designed to analyze the performance of various
technologies in different browsers.

##Notes

Firefox and Chrome came up with distinct API's for audio
manipulation.
