#Pure DOM Vs. canvas-based game

Both solutions are viable, but do not cover the same needs. The
solution depends on the game type.

Choosing this solution [canvas] means reducing the usage of CSS
and HTML, so everything these technologies gives us now has to be
implemented in JavaScript.

For now, pure DOM approach is usually better because it takes more
advantage of web technologies.

The more advanced engines become, the less important these micro
optimizations will become.
