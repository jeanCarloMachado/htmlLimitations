#Pure DOM Vs. canvas-based game

Both solutions are viable, but do not cover the same needs. The
solution depends on the game type.

Choosing this solution [canvas] means reducing the usage of CSS
and HTML, so everything these technologies gives us now has to be
implemented in JavaScript.

For now, pure DOM approach is usually better because it takes more
advantage of web technologies.

The good thing with HTML- and JavaScript-based applications is
that the technology itself forces you into some kind of structure.

A good tool to perform this [micro optimizations] is found at jsfiddle.net.
The more advanced engines become, the less important these micro
optimizations will become.

As your skill level improves, you will find that moving more
functionality to the shader can improve perfomance and offer a
wide range of cool effects and realism.

One can only hope that as browser technology progress and WebGL
becomes more robustly supported, the guarantees on frame rate will
become more robust as well.

The crucial and most complicated stage of develpment, which is
choosing the technology.

technologies in different browsers.
