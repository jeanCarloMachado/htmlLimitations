HTTML5 Games most wanted
2012

[open web technologies] ..have evolved since the dawn of the
internet and have been proven as reliable and stable while other
technologies rise and fall beside them.

..very little investment needs to be made to begin developing
games using open web technologies.


HTML5 canvas is a JavaScript API and corresponding HTML element
that allows for bitmap graphics to be created and edited within
the browser.

The negative aspects of canvas are that performance varies across
platforms and animation functionality isn't built in.

SVG is a 2D solution that used the document object model (DOM) to
produce and manager vector graphics. The negative aspects of SVG
are that it isn't as popular as canvas and that it doesn't cope as
well with pixel-perfect precision.

WebGl is based on OpenGl ES 2.0. It's hardware accelerated (fast)
and allows for some pretty complex visual effects. The negative
aspects are that it is complicated to learn and isn't supported by
Internet Exploer yet.

The limitation of the HTML5 audio element is that it's purpose is
really to play single audio files, like background music within a
game.

##Notes

Firefox and Chrome came up with distinct API's for audio
manipulation.
