#The current state of cross-platform game development for different device types
##Stefan Bruins 2014

##Quotes

.. a cross-platform game as a game that can run on more than one
platform, while the other more specific interpretation has the
additional requirement that the game instance can be accessed from
different platforms.

Many of the issues in cross-platform game design are nos specific
for games but apply to software in general.

A platform can be seen both as a constraint and as a support.

Cross-platform game development is a relatively new research area.

The development of these games [cross platform one's] involves
a spectrum of challenges that range from technical issues to user
experience issues.

Few studies have been done on games that can run on two entirely
different device types. (referenced)

Only very few works are directly related to the practical side
cross-media game development between different strongly
heterogeneous devices.

The traditional way of getting  software to run on multiple
platforms is porting.

##Comments

Uses the Browser Quest game of Mozilla as inspiration.
Main issues he cite: make the software run on different platforms,
each platform has different resources.
References the benefits of cross-media applications.
List the methods of cross platforming: cross-compilation, virtual
machines, pure web applications and hybrid web applications.
