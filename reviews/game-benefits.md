Children use play to work them out through pretend-based narratives
enacted either alone or with friends

"One can no more say what the effects of video games are, than on can
say what the effects of food are (Baliver et al. 2011, p. 763).

Those in shooter video game condition show faster and more accurate
attention allocation, higher spatial resolution in visual processing and
enhanced mental rotation abilities.

Established the power of spatial skills in predicting achievement in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Shooter game players allocate their attentional resources more
efficiently and filter attentional resources more efficiently.

"The most robust effects on cognitive performance come from playing
shooter video games..."

"Playing any kind of video game, regardless of whether or not it is
violent, enhances children's creative capacities."

Motivational styles characterized by persistence and continuous
effortful engagement are key contributors to success and achievement.

Video games seem to enhance a suite of cognitive functions, some of
which appear to generalize to real-world contexts.

If intelligence or ability is presumed to be a mark of effortful
engagement, failure signals the need to remain engaged and bolster one's
efforts.

Positive attitude toward failure predicts better academic performance.

The development of a persistent motivational style charged with positive
affect my, in turn, lead to lasting educational success (Ventura et al,
2013).

Gaming may be among the most efficient and effective means by which
children and youth generate positive feeling.

Experiencing positive emotions may help broaden the number of behaviors
one perceives as both possible and motivating and build social
relationships that provide support for goal pursuit and coping with failure.

Positive emotions are thus the bedrock for well-being.

The biggest difference in the characteristics of video games today,
compared to their predecessors of 10 to 20 years ago, is their pervasive
social nature.

Players who play violent games that encourage cooperative play are more
likely to exhibit helpful gaming behaviours online and off-line than
those who play nonviolent games.

The picture is much more complex than popular press headlines
suggest(Ferguson, 2013)

More than 70% of the individual who play games are adults.

Because of their diversity in items of genres and the vast array
of dimensions on which video games can vary, a comprehensive
taxonomy of contemporary games is exceedingly difficult to develop
(many have tried). pg 60
